// follow back of the notebook(da labs) for revision of hashing


leetcode question is different than the question asked in basic hashing
in question by tuf we just need to find highest occurring element and lowest occurring element in an array
which we can do by map. add all elements as keys values as their counts and then loop map and find the highest value and return key there.

but in leetcode it is different although i thought of brute force

// brute force is -
        // sort in descending then take target as highest number
        // then loop through the array that is left after the highest number
        // and fill other numbers with k and if we get number == target then we can 
        // put inside count integer(check count condition for highest freq).
        // once the loop is over we will get our max count
